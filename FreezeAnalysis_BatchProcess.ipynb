    "The following code was designed in order to load in and score motion/freezing data from video files in batch. This code should be run with carefully selected parameters using the more extensive visualization options provided in FreezeAnalysis.ipynb.  In addition to saving frame by frame motion/freezing information for each video in separate csv files, bins can also be defined for summarizing videos (e.g. minute by minute).  All summary information will be saved in a single file.  If no bins are defined, the code will automatically create a summary file that lists average session motion/freezing per video.\n",
