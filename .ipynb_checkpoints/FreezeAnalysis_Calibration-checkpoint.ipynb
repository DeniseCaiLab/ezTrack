    "The following code was designed to be used in conjunction with FreezeAnalysis_Individual.ipynb and FreezeAnalysis_BatchProcess.ipynb in order to set the motion threshold parameter.  By examining basal fluctuation in pixel intensities in a video where no animal is present, it is possible to set a threshold for detecting pixel change values that are attributable to animal motion, as oppposed to low-level fluctuation that occurs with no animal present.  Videos must be loaded in which no animal is present in the environment.  If multiple contexts are to be used, and freezing is to be compared across them, it is best to eventually use the same motion threshold across contexts, either taking the average of the various contexts or taking the maxiumum. \n",

By looking at the distribution of frame-by-frame change values for each pixel, a threshold is then set for determining what changes are likely to be attributable to the animal moving versus random fluctuation.  Currently, cutoff is is set to twice the 99.99 percentile.   A plot of grayscale change values is also provided.
