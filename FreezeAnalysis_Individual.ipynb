    "The following code was designed in order to load in and score motion/freezing data from video files. It allows for cropping of the video frame to reduce influence of miniscope/optogenetic cables.  After initally loading in the video, the user is able to crop the video frame by adjusting a single variable.  Motion is then detected by capturing the number of pixels whose frame by frame grayscale change value exceeds a threshold (determined using FreezeAnalysis_Calibration.ipynb).  Freezing is then assessed by calculating when motion drops below a user-defined threshold.  The user is able to visualize raw video, animal motion, and whether an animal is deemed to be freezing in order optimize parameters.  Final output is a csv which provides frame by frame motion and freezing across the session.  Additionally, summary file can be generated which allows user to get motion/freezing for specified time bins.  With the exception of setting the file path and small number of parameters (ie frames per second in video, freezing threshold), user can run through code.  Once parameters are found that work well, batch processing of multiple videos can be performed using FreezeAnalysis_BatchProcess.ipynb.\n",
